This is a firt attempt at trying to create a game for the iPad and iPhone.

Currently have background tiles appearing along with a wizard character that
will walk across screen when a location is tapped. There is also an attack
button which can be used to fire a magic missile at the grub on screen.

It is now possible to run the game on a iphone with an external monitor. A
very simple joy pad appears on the screen of the iphone which allows you
to move the wizard around the screen. There are some optimization issuse
at the moment, mostly focused around the firing animation.

Game Writen for iOS7 in objective - C using the new Sprite Kit.
