This is a firt attempt at trying to create a game for the iPad.

Currently have background tiles appearing along with a wizard character that
will walk across screen when a location is tapped. There is also an attack
button which can be used to fire a magic missile, this currently only works
when facing to the right. I'm following the Advanture example code provided 
:by apple as a base for this programe.

Game Writen for iOS7 in objective - C using the new Sprite Kit.
