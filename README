This is a firt attempt at trying to create a game for the iPad and iPhone.

Currently have background tiles appearing along with a wizard character that
will walk across screen when a location is tapped. There is also an attack
button which can be used to fire a magic missile at the grub that appears on
screen. I'm following the Advanture example code provided by apple as a base
for this program.

The end result should be a universal application which can be used on the
ipad or on the iphone. It should also support external monitors, were the iphone
can be used as a joypad.

Game Writen for iOS7 in objective - C using the new Sprite Kit.
