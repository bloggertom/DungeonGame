This is a firt attempt at trying to create a game for the iPad.

Currently have background tiles appearing along with a wizard character that
will walk across screen when a location is tapped. There is also an attack
button which can be used to fire a magic missile, this currently only works
when facing to the right. I'm following the Advanture example code provided 
:by apple as a base for this programe.

Currently crashes if you attempt to attack left, this is probably
due to it trying to run frames which arn't there.

Game Writen for iOS7 in objective - C using the new Sprite Kit.
