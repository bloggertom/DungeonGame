#Dungeon Style Game

This is a firt attempt at trying to create a game for the iPad and iPhone.

This project is changing quickly with frequent updates. This readme
will be updated with current progress

Game written for iOS using the new SpriteKit.

## Currently
The project is part way through maze generation. This will be used to 
create a map which can be explored by the character. The maze aspect
is currently working and is displayed in the bottom left of the screen.

There are currently debugging tiles around the edge of this maze which will
become the walls when finished. I have plans to try and make a stand allown
set of classes which can be used for level generation with the ability to use
your own maze generator.

A wizard will display on screen if start game is pushed, he can move around
and shoot magic missile. A grub appears but at the moment collition detection
seems to have broken between it and the magic missile.

It is now possible to run the game on a iPhone with an external monitor. A
very simple joy pad appears on the screen of the iphone which allows you
to move the wizard around the screen.
