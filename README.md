#Dungeon Style Game

This is a firt attempt at trying to create a game for the iPad and iPhone.

Currently have background tiles appearing along with a wizard character that
will walk across screen when a location is tapped. There is also an attack
button which can be used to fire a magic missile at the grub on screen. Work
is progressing on creating a map builder which will make use of a maz
generator.

It is now possible to run the game on a iPhone with an external monitor. A
very simple joy pad appears on the screen of the iphone which allows you
to move the wizard around the screen.

Game Writen for iOS7 in objective - C using the new Sprite Kit.
